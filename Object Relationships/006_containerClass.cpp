    Notes : 

    1. A container class is a class designed to hold and organize multiple instances of another type (either another class, or a fundamental type). There are many different kinds of container classes, each of which has various advantages, disadvantages, and restrictions in their use. By far the most commonly used container in programming is the array, which you have already seen many examples of. Although C++ has built-in array functionality, programmers will often use an array container class (std::array or std::vector) instead because of the additional benefits they provide. 

    2. Types of containers : Container classes generally come in two different varieties. Value containers are compositions that store copies of the objects that they are holding (and thus are responsible for creating and destroying those copies). Reference containers are aggregations that store pointers or references to other objects (and thus are not responsible for creation or destruction of those objects).
