    Notes : 

    1. Semantic errors, which occur when you write code that does not do what you intended. The compiler generally will not catch semantic errors (though in some cases, smart compilers may be able to generate a warning).

    2. Semantic errors can cause most of the same symptoms of undefined behavior, such as causing the program to produce the wrong results, causing erratic behavior, corrupting program data, causing the program to crash -- or they may not have any impact at all.

    3. Conditional logic errors - One of the most common types of semantic errors is a conditional logic error. A conditional logic error occurs when the programmer incorrectly codes the logic of a conditional statement or loop condition. 

    4. Infinite loops

    5. Off-by-one errors - An off-by-one error is an error that occurs when a loop executes one too many or one too few times.

    6. Incorrect operator precedence 

    7. Precision issues with floating point types

    8. Accidental null statements
