#include <iostream>

/*
    Notes : 

    1. The value of an object is stored as a sequence of bits, and the data type of the object tells the compiler how to interpret those bits into meaningful values.

    2. The process of producing a new value of some type from a value of a different type is called a conversion.

    3. Type conversion can be invoked in one of two ways: either implicitly (as needed by the compiler), or explicitly (when requested by the programmer). 

    4. Implicit type conversion (also called automatic type conversion or coercion) is performed automatically by the compiler when one data type is required, but a different data type is supplied. The vast majority of type conversions in C++ are implicit type conversions

    5. When a type conversion is invoked (whether implicitly or explicitly), the compiler will determine whether it can convert the value from the current type to the desired type. If a valid conversion can be found, then the compiler will produce a new value of the desired type. Note that type conversions donâ€™t change the value or type of the value or object being converted.

    6. The standard conversions - 

        The C++ language standard defines how different fundamental types (and in some cases, compound types) can be converted to other types. These conversion rules are called the standard conversions.

    7. The standard conversions can be broadly divided into 4 categories, each covering different types of conversions:

        1. Numeric promotions 
        2. Numeric conversions 
        3. Arithmetic conversions
        4. Other conversions
